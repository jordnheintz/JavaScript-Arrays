# JavaScript Arrays Lab


## The Set Up

- You will need to create a new repository.
- Make sure to number the prompts you are answering in order to identify what is being answered.


### The Tasks

#### Exercise One

- Create new file called `Prompts.JS`

1. Read the steps below and code

   - Declare an array named `songs` that contains five different names of songs as strings.

   - Access the **first** song in the array and print it to the console

   - Now do the same with the **third** song in the array.

     > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

   - Write one line of code that changes the value of the **last** song in the array to `"Happy"` (overwriting the previous value).

   - Create a new variable called `jamFour` and set it equal to the fourth song in the array.

   - Add another song to the end of the array.

     > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

   - Add another song to the **beginning** of the array.

   - Print the length of the array to the console

   - Remove the last song from the end of array, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.

     > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

   - Write a `for loop` to iterate through every song in the array and print each song's value to the console.

   - Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every song's value and every song's index in this format: `3, "Office Theme"` or `0, "Billy Jean"` etc.

   - Declare a variable named `lastSong` that will always point to the last element of the `songs` array, no matter how many
     songs are in the array.

2. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

#### Exercise Two

- Create new file called `numbers.js`

1. Declare an array of at least 6 integers. Create a function that will sort the integer array in _ascending_ and _descending_ order.

2. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

#### Exercise Three

3. Create a list of your favorite movies, music, or video games using a multidimensional array.

   - First decide on the genres. Need at least 3 genres.
   
      - Ex: For movies - action, thriller, comedy. 

   - Add titles to each genre. At least 2 titles per genre

   - Create a series of statements to access elements

     - Access the `second` element of the `third` array

     - Replace the `first` element of the `second` array with another

     - Using `for` loops, iterate through the arrays and print the elements to the console.

4. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.
